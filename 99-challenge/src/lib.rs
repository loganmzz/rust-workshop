//! 99 Challenge
//! --------------
//!
//! Welcome to last step of this Rust workshop.
//!
//! The task is to make a **Pull Request** on the rust project `please`, the universal project builder.
//!
//! # Purpose
//!
//! With `please`, switching from one technology to the next is easy, no need to remember all the commands!
//! Write `please build` to build the project, `please run` to run it! Works with every language available.
//!
//! Right now, only `rust` is supported. So the task is to support a new language.
//! You pick the one your prefer and make a `PR` for it.
//!
//! **Clone the repo**: `git clone https://github.com/RustBeginners/please`
//!
//! # Tips
//!
//! * Create a new **Platform** in `src/platform/<my_platform>.rs`
//!
//! * Implement the `trait Platform` define in [src/platform/mod.rs](https://github.com/RustBeginners/please/blob/master/src/platform/mod.rs)
//!
//! * Get an example (rust) of a platform implementation here: [src/platform/rust.rs](https://github.com/RustBeginners/please/blob/master/src/platform/rust.rs)
